# PokemonAPI's Goal #

The purpose of this software is to make development of programs interacting with the PokeTibia client's faster, more reliable, and extensible. There has yet to be a fully open source API with the same goal as us, and of the open source code out there already ours differs completely. PokemonAPI is completely based on object-oriented principles, and will make development much easier and quicker for first time programmers and seasoned developers alike. The end result is a dynamic link library that can be included in any project and will provide the core for many programs to come.
